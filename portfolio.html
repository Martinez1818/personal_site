            <img class="portfolio-img" src="images/Zoo-Project.png" alt="Zoo website">
        <p>As part of my full-stack development bootcamp, I created a dynamic Zoo Page that organizes and displays information about various animals. The project required me to apply key HTML semantic tags such as header, footer, article, and section to structure the page effectively. I included headers and titles for each animal category (bears, giraffes, lions, monkeys, and alligators), listed the names of the animals, and provided detailed descriptions for each one using paragraphs and sections.</p>
        <p>For each animal, I incorporated external links to relevant fact pages for quick access to more information. Additionally, I added images for every animal to enhance the page’s visual appeal. I also included comments throughout the code to make it easier for others to understand and maintain the project. This project was a great opportunity to refine my skills in semantic HTML, structure web content, and improve user experience.</p>

            <img class="portfolio-img" src="images/Grocer-List.png" alt="Grocery List">
        <p>In this project, I designed a categorized Grocery List that incorporates key HTML semantic tags for a well-structured and accessible layout. Each grocery category was placed inside a distinct section, with sections and headers styled with unique background colors to create visual separation. I used various heading levels to differentiate the text hierarchy and incorporated two types of lists to display the grocery items.</p>
        <p>To enhance the layout, I applied the box model to add borders and spacing to each section, ensuring a clean and organized appearance. The project also required the use of external, internal, and inline CSS styles, allowing me to demonstrate my understanding of different styling methods. Additionally, I included two well-spaced images, using padding to ensure they didn’t overlap with text elements. This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of CSS and HTML structure while focusing on design aesthetics.</p>
