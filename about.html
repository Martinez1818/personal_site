        <p>“Soccer has been a major part of my life since I first kicked a ball at age 10. When I was starting out, my older and more experienced cousin helped me develop my skills, which wasn’t always easy. I wasn’t the best growing up, but I never gave up, pushing myself even when things got frustrating. That dedication paid off in high school, when I earned a spot on the varsity team and played for three years, growing as both a player and a teammate. Through the challenges, I learned that perseverance, even in tough times, builds leadership and strengthens teamwork—lessons that have stayed with me both on and off the field.”</p>

        <p>“Soccer kept me lean throughout my youth with its intense training and non-stop running. At 25, I hit the gym to add muscle and boost my strength for soccer. The progress I saw fueled my determination to keep going, and working out quickly became a passion in itself. Through this journey, I also developed better habits like focusing on nutrition and prioritizing sleep to optimize recovery. Ultimately, it taught me that discipline and consistency pay off both in fitness and in life.”
